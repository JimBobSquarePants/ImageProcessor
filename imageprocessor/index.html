    <h1>ImageProcessor</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor</strong> is a lightweight library designed to make manipulation of images easier using .NET 4.5+.
    </p>
    <p>
        It contains multiple methods within the core functionality that allows for image manipulation via the
        <a href="imagefactory.html">ImageFactory</a> class. This has a fluent API which allows you to easily chain methods to deliver the desired output.
    </p>
    <p>
        ImageProcessor contains no web specific components so is suitable for both desktop and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The base library supports processing of jpg, jpeg, png, png8, gif (both animated and static), bmp, and tiff file formats.
